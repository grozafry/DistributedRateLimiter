# Distributed Rate Limiter - Product Flow

## Purpose
The Distributed Rate Limiter is a robust, scalable service designed to control and manage the rate of incoming requests in a distributed system. It helps prevent system overload, ensures fair usage, and protects against potential DoS attacks.

## Key Features
1. Multiple rate-limiting strategies:
   - Fixed window
   - Sliding window
   - Token bucket
2. Flexible limiting criteria:
   - By API key
   - By user
   - By IP address
3. Distributed architecture for high availability and scalability
4. Real-time monitoring and alerting
5. Easy integration with existing systems via REST API

## Components
1. Rate Limiter Service: Core service implementing rate-limiting logic
2. Redis: For storing rate-limiting data and enabling distributed coordination
3. Kafka: For logging and potential future expansion (e.g., analytics)
4. Admin Dashboard: For configuration and monitoring

## Use Cases
1. API Gateway: Protect backend services from excessive requests
2. SaaS Platforms: Enforce usage tiers and prevent abuse
3. E-commerce: Prevent bots from overwhelming the system during flash sales
4. Social Media: Control the rate of posts or actions per user

## Benefits
1. Improved system stability and performance
2. Fair resource allocation among users or clients
3. Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
4. Flexible configuration for different use cases
5. Scalability to handle growing traffic



# Distributed Rate Limiter: Low-Level Design

## 1. System Components

### 1.1 Rate Limiter Service
- Implemented as a Spring Boot application
- Exposes REST API for rate-limiting decisions
- Implements rate-limiting algorithms
- Interacts with Redis for distributed state management
- Publishes events to Kafka for logging and analytics

### 1.2 Redis Cluster
- Stores rate-limiting data (counters, timestamps)
- Enables distributed locking for concurrency control
- Supports sliding window implementation

### 1.3 Kafka Cluster
- Logs rate-limiting events
- Enables future expansion for analytics and monitoring

### 1.4 Admin Dashboard
- Spring Boot application with a React frontend
- Provides UI for configuration and monitoring

## 2. Core Classes and Interfaces

### 2.1 RateLimiter Interface
```java
public interface RateLimiter {
    boolean allowRequest(String key, int limit, int windowSeconds);
}
```

### 2.2 FixedWindowRateLimiter
```java
@Service
public class FixedWindowRateLimiter implements RateLimiter {
    private final RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;
    
    // Implementation
}
```

### 2.3 SlidingWindowRateLimiter
```java
@Service
public class SlidingWindowRateLimiter implements RateLimiter {
    private final RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;
    
    // Implementation
}
```

### 2.4 TokenBucketRateLimiter
```java
@Service
public class TokenBucketRateLimiter implements RateLimiter {
    private final RedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;
    
    // Implementation
}
```

### 2.5 RateLimitingController
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/ratelimit")
public class RateLimitingController {
    private final Map<String, RateLimiter> rateLimiters;
    
    // Endpoints for rate-limiting decisions
}
```

### 2.6 KafkaProducer
```java
@Service
public class KafkaProducer {
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;
    
    // Methods to publish rate-limiting events
}
```

## 3. Data Models

### 3.1 RateLimitConfig
```java
public class RateLimitConfig {
    private String key;
    private int limit;
    private int windowSeconds;
    private String strategy;
    // getters and setters
}
```

### 3.2 RateLimitEvent
```java
public class RateLimitEvent {
    private String key;
    private boolean allowed;
    private long timestamp;
    // getters and setters
}
```

## 4. Key Algorithms

### 4.1 Fixed Window
1. Generate key: `{identifier}:{timestamp / windowSize}`
2. Increment counter in Redis
3. If counter <= limit, allow; else, reject

### 4.2 Sliding Window
1. Generate current window key and previous window key
2. Get counts from both windows
3. Calculate weighted sum of counts
4. If weighted sum <= limit, allow; else, reject

### 4.3 Token Bucket
1. Get last refill timestamp and token count from Redis
2. Calculate tokens to add based on elapsed time
3. Update token count and timestamp
4. If tokens available, decrement and allow; else, reject

## 5. Concurrency Handling
- Use Redis' atomic operations (INCR, EXPIRE) to handle race conditions
- Implement distributed locking for complex operations

## 6. Scalability Considerations
- Stateless Rate Limiter Service allows horizontal scaling
- Redis Cluster for data distribution and high availability
- Kafka partitioning for log scalability

## 7. Monitoring and Alerting
- Implement Micrometer for metrics collection
- Use Prometheus for metrics storage
- Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Configure alerts for high rejection rates or service issues

## 8. Security Considerations
- Implement API key authentication for the Rate Limiter Service
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage

This Low-Level Design provides a solid foundation for implementing the Distributed Rate Limiter. It addresses the core functionality, scalability, and monitoring aspects of the system.
